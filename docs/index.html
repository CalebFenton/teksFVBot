<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Of course, can click everywhere on your farm to harvest / plow / plant</li>
  <li>Can even farm tree lines</li>
  <li>Can check for menus in the way or if your cursor has a sickle present (so it knows it's going to harvest)</li>
  <li>Hotkeys make starting and stopping easy</li>
  <li>Option to lock the mouse while running so you don't screw anything up</li>
  <li>Works well with different resolutions, and if it doesn't, the offsets are configurable</li>
  <li>Support for saving settings into multiple profiles</li>
  <li>Hotkeys only active when FarmVille is full-screened and it minimizes to tray, so you can always keep it running</li>
  <li>Almost everything is configurable</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of this bot was to make the game bearable while I had to play it since my girlfriend was out of the country with no Internet, and also to learn AutoIt3. I have a few other ideas for programs and I wanted to explore AutoIt as an option for the language. I looked for other bots that could do this stuff, but I couldn't find any and the only one that looked decent costed 5 euros. I laughed.</p>

<p>Right now the bot is fairly simple and works well for my needs. If more people use it, I'll consider making it more intelligent. It should be fairly easy to get it to determine how large your farm is, calculate the time it would take to do everything, and plow / harvest and plant whatever you want it to with just a key press and some time with only a few assumed conditions like being fully zoomed out and full screened.</p>

<strong>How regular farming works:</strong><br />

<p>1. Run the bot and move it into a corner so it wont be in the way when you full screen the game. You can also minimize it but then you'll miss all the little details and flares I added to the UI, so I wouldn't recommend it.</p>

<p>3. Maximize FarmVille and zoom out fully (you can use mouse wheel for zoom)</p>

<p>4. Position yourself so you're trapped. Either surround yourself with hay bales or fences or something. One good way is to use the starting position of your character and put hay bales in all four directions there. If you can't move to the location you will auto-harvest, which makes things much faster.</p>

<p>5. Position your mouse over the far left tile of your farm and hit HOME on your keyboard. This will set your &quot;home&quot; location. Farming will start from here.</p>

<p>6. Hit the INSERT key to start or stop clicking all the tiles on your farm. It will resume on your home location. This means if something screws up, set your home location over the next row and hit insert again.</p>

<p>7. Repeat until all your crops are done and planted then <strong>close the window</strong> and step away from that retarded game. Go outside and get some ice cream or something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>If you want to try tree farming:</strong></p>

<p>1. Press page up or page down with the game full screened until the Home location is set to Top-Left or Top-Right depending on the tree line you want to harvest.</p>

<p>2. This is the somewhat tricky part. Set the home location on the first tree you want to harvest. Sometimes the base of the tree works best, sometimes the top does. Find what works and keep that. The home location will be saved to your profile.</p>

<p>3. Hit DELETE to start tree farming. </p>

<p>Most everything else is self explanitory. Play with it on test mode and figure it out and feel free to e-mail me any questions at tekproxy^gmail-dot-com.</p>
